**About Me**

I am a first year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, [<span style="color:blue">University of Oxford</span>](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk). Before that, I was a senior engineer in [<span style="color:blue">Petuum, Inc.</span>](http://www.petuum.com), an AI Company incubated by the Machine Learning Department, [<span style="color:blue">Carnegie Mellon University</span>](https://www.ml.cmu.edu), where I did research with a group of brilliant people. I obtained my M.S. degree from the Department of Statistical Science, [<span style="color:blue">Cornell University</span>](https://stat.cornell.edu).
My research focuses on the interaction among machine learning, computer vision, optimization, and quantum computing.
