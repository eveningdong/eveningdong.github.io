**About Me**

I am a research engineer in Petuum, Inc..

I obtained my M.S. degree from the Department of Statistical Science, Computing and Information Science (CIS), Cornell University in January 2017. I obtained my B.S. degree from the Department of Mathematical Sciences, School of Physical Sciences, University of Liverpool in July 2015.  

My research interests are machine learning, computer vision, and medical image analysis. In addition, I have experience on autonomous driving, computational biology and video analysis.

Currently, I focus on domain adaptation, few-shot learning, reinforcement learning, and distributed learning.

In Petuum, Inc., I am glad that I have the oppurtunity to meet a lot of awesome people from Machine Learning Department, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. I learn a lot from Petuum, Inc.. Namely, I receive dedicated instructions from  [<span style="color:blue">Prof. Eric P. Xing</span>](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/), [<span style="color:blue">Prof. Min Xu</span>](https://sites.google.com/view/xulab/home), Prof. Xiaodan Liang, Dr. Wei Dai, Dr. Pengtao Xie and Hong Wu. Especially, I want to thank [<span style="color:blue">Prof. Xiaodan Liang</span>](https://lemondan.github.io/) and [<span style="color:blue">Dr. Wei Dai</span>](http://davidwd.org/) for their academic instructions in computer vision and distributed machine learning. Personally, I want to thank [<span style="color:blue">Hong Wu</span>](http://xunzhangthu.org/about/), my best (<span style="color:red">not the one of</span>) friend in Petuum, Inc., for his help in software engineering and the selfless sharing of his working experience and industrial insights, which is really helpful for my future success.
