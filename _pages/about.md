**About Me**

My Chinese name is 董楠卿. I am a Departmental Head, Associate Professor, and Doctoral Supervisor. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [<span style="color:blue">Department of Computer Science</span>](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk), [<span style="color:blue">University of Oxford</span>](http://www.ox.ac.uk). I was gernoursly funded by the University of Oxford with a full scholarship. Prior to Oxford, I did research at the [<span style="color:blue">Machine Learning Department</span>](https://www.ml.cmu.edu), [<span style="color:blue">Carnegie Mellon University</span>](https://www.cmu.edu). I obtained my M.S. degree from the [<span style="color:blue">Department of Statistical Science</span>](https://stat.cornell.edu), [<span style="color:blue">Cornell University</span>](https://www.cornell.edu). My research focuses on the interactions among machine learning, computer vision, optimization, and AI for science. 

In addition to my academic roles, I am also an artist, comedian, gamer, photographer, traveller, and writer. I keep fighting until the reunification of my motherland, great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and world peace. Proletarier aller Länder, vereinigt euch!
