I am a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, [<span style="color:blue">University of Oxford</span>]](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk). Before that, I was a research engineer in [<span style="color:blue">Petuum, Inc.</span>]](http://www.petuum.com), a start-up incubated by the Machine Learning Department, School of Computer Science, [<span style="color:blue">Carnegie Mellon University</span>]](https://www.ml.cmu.edu). I obtained my M.S. degree from the Department of Statistical Science, [<span style="color:blue">Cornell University</span>]](https://stat.cornell.edu).
My research interests are machine learning, computer vision, optimization and quantum computer science.
